\section{Introduction and Contributions}
The MiniBlockchain project is a simplified implementation of a blockchain system designed to demonstrate the core principles and functionalities of blockchain technology. This project includes essential components such as blocks, transactions, a mempool, a miner, and a blockchain ledger. It also incorporates features like proof-of-work, Merkle trees for transaction verification, and digital signatures for secure transactions.

The project is structured to simulate a basic blockchain network where users can create transactions, miners can validate and add blocks to the blockchain, and the integrity of the blockchain can be verified. The implementation is written in Java and provides a clear and modular design, making it an excellent educational tool for understanding blockchain concepts.

Key features of the MiniBlockchain project include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Block and Blockchain Management}: Blocks store transaction data, and the blockchain maintains a sequential ledger of all blocks.
    \item \textbf{Proof-of-Work}: A mining mechanism ensures that blocks meet a specific difficulty target before being added to the blockchain.
    \item \textbf{Merkle Trees}: Used to verify the integrity of transactions within a block.
    \item \textbf{Digital Signatures}: Transactions are signed using RSA encryption to ensure authenticity and prevent tampering.
    \item \textbf{User and Transaction Management}: Users can create transactions, and a mempool temporarily stores pending transactions before they are mined into blocks.
\end{itemize}

This project serves as a foundation for exploring blockchain technology and can be extended to include more advanced features such as smart contracts, consensus algorithms, and distributed networking.

\section{Related Tools/Libraries}
The project relies on the following tools and libraries:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Java Standard Library}: For core functionalities like data structures (e.g., \texttt{HashMap}, \texttt{ArrayList}, \texttt{LinkedList}), cryptography, and I/O operations.
    \item \textbf{javax.crypto}: For RSA encryption and decryption using the \texttt{Cipher} class.
    \item \textbf{java.security}: For generating cryptographic keys (e.g., \texttt{KeyPairGenerator}, \texttt{PublicKey}, \texttt{PrivateKey}) and hashing algorithms (e.g., \texttt{MessageDigest} for SHA-256).
    \item \textbf{java.time}: For timestamp generation using \texttt{Instant}.
    \item \textbf{java.math.BigInteger}: For handling large numbers in proof-of-work calculations.
\end{itemize}

\section{Pipeline Flow of the Blockchain System}

The pipeline flow of the blockchain system is designed to simulate the core functionalities of a blockchain. Below is a detailed explanation of each step:

\subsection{User Creation}
Users are created with unique public-private key pairs and wallet addresses. This ensures that each user has a secure identity within the blockchain system.

\subsection{Transaction Generation}
Users create transactions by specifying the amount to transfer and the recipient's address. Each transaction is digitally signed by the sender to ensure authenticity and integrity.

\subsection{Transaction Validation}
Transactions are validated using cryptographic techniques. This includes verifying the sender's digital signature and checking wallet balances to ensure the transaction is legitimate and untampered.

\subsection{MemPool Management}
Valid transactions are added to the mempool, a temporary storage for pending transactions waiting to be included in a block.

\subsection{Mining}
The miner collects transactions from the mempool, validates them, and creates a new block. The miner performs proof-of-work by solving a cryptographic puzzle to find a valid nonce.

\subsection{Blockchain Update}
Once a block is successfully mined, it is added to the blockchain after verification. The blockchain is updated to include the new block, and the mempool is cleared of the included transactions.

\subsection{Verification}
The entire blockchain is periodically verified to ensure its integrity. This includes checking the hashes, Merkle roots, and proof-of-work for each block.

\section{Overall Architecture of the Blockchain System}

The architecture of the blockchain system is modular and consists of the following components:

\subsection{UserManager}
Manages user data, including public-private key pairs and wallet balances. Provides methods for user creation, retrieval, and management.

\subsection{Transaction}
Represents a transaction with details such as sender, receiver, amount, and digital signature. Ensures data integrity through unique transaction IDs.

\subsection{MemPool}
A temporary storage for pending transactions. Provides methods to add and collect transactions for mining.

\subsection{Block}
Represents a block in the blockchain. Contains metadata such as the previous block hash, timestamp, nonce, difficulty, Merkle root, and transactions.

\subsection{BlockChain}
Manages the chain of blocks. Ensures that blocks are added sequentially and that proof-of-work is satisfied.

\subsection{Miner}
Handles the mining process, including proof-of-work and block creation. Collects valid transactions from the mempool and attempts to solve the cryptographic puzzle.

\subsection{Verifier}
Validates transactions, blocks, and the entire blockchain. Ensures that the blockchain remains tamper-proof and consistent.

\subsection{MerkleTree}
Calculates the Merkle root for a set of transactions. Ensures transaction integrity within a block.

\section{Experimental Results}
\subsection{Simulation}
The simulation of the MiniBlockchain system was conducted to validate its core functionalities, including transaction validation, mining, and blockchain verification. Below are the detailed results:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Transaction Validation}: Transactions were tested for validity before and after tampering. Initially, valid transactions were successfully verified using the implemented verification mechanism. When transaction details, such as the amount, were altered, the system detected the tampering and flagged the transaction as invalid. This demonstrates the robustness of the digital signature mechanism in ensuring transaction integrity.

    \item \textbf{Mining Process}: The mining process was simulated with multiple transactions in the mempool. Miners successfully collected valid transactions, created new blocks, and solved the proof-of-work puzzle within the specified timeout. The mined blocks were added to the blockchain, and their hashes satisfied the difficulty target. This highlights the effectiveness of the proof-of-work mechanism in maintaining blockchain security.

    \item \textbf{Blockchain Verification}: The entire blockchain was verified to ensure its integrity. Each block's header, transactions, and proof-of-work were validated. The verification process successfully detected tampered blocks and flagged them as invalid. This demonstrates the system's ability to maintain a tamper-proof and consistent blockchain.

    \item \textbf{Merkle Tree Validation}: The Merkle tree was used to verify the integrity of transactions within a block. The generated Merkle root matched the stored Merkle root for valid blocks. When transactions were altered, the Merkle root mismatch was detected, ensuring the integrity of the block's transaction data.

    \item \textbf{Performance Observations}: Mining time increased with the difficulty of the proof-of-work puzzle, as expected. This demonstrates the scalability of the mining process and its ability to adapt to varying difficulty levels. The system efficiently handled multiple transactions and users, showcasing its capability to simulate a realistic blockchain environment.

    \item \textbf{Malicious Actions}: Various malicious actions, such as altering block headers, adding fraudulent transactions, and modifying existing transactions, were simulated. The system successfully detected these actions during the verification process, ensuring the blockchain's security and reliability.
\end{itemize}

These results validate the MiniBlockchain project's implementation of core blockchain functionalities, including transaction validation, mining, and verification. The system effectively ensures data integrity, security, and consistency, making it a reliable educational tool for understanding blockchain technology.

\subsection{Observations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Mining time increases with the difficulty of proof-of-work.
    \item Tampered transactions are successfully detected and rejected.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
The MiniBlockChain project demonstrates the core functionalities of a blockchain system, including transaction validation, mining, and block verification. The system ensures data integrity and security through cryptographic techniques and proof-of-work.
